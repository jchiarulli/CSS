# CSS Syntax

## CSS is a Collection of Rules
* Each rule targets a specific tag or element on a HTML document
  * Rule which targets all 'p' tags on a page
  * Rule which targets all tags with an #id
  * Rule which targets all 'a' tags in the #nav

## Rules Come in 2 Parts
* All CSS rules are made of two components:
  * Selector - #page-header
  * Declaration - { font-size: 10px; } 

## Selectors
* Selectors can target tag names, ID's, classes, and many other things
* Examples:
  * #header p { declaration }
  * .comment div { declaration }
  * li { declaration }

## Declaration
* Declarations contain properties and values
* Examples:
  * #selector { font-size: 10px; }
  * #selector { font-size: 10px; color red;}
